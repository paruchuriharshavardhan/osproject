 The main objective of this project is to develop a simulator that enables users to understand and visualize how various CPU scheduling algorithms work. By simulating these algorithms,
 users can gain insights into their performance characteristics, such as efficiency and responsiveness. The project is intended to serve as an educational tool for academic use or for 
 individuals interested in computer science concepts.
